# AdvancedHPC-Project
This repository contains the results obtained for the project of the Advanced High Performance Computing exam in University of Trieste. The project consists of 3 exercises:
- [Distributed_MatMul](/Distributed_MatMul/): an implementation of a distributed matrix-matrix multiplication using MPI and CUDA;
- [Jacobi](/Jacobi/): an implementation of the Jacobi algorithm to solve Laplace's equation in distributed memory, using MPI and OpenACC;
- [Jacobi-OneSide](/Jacobi-OneSide/): an implementation of the Jacobi algorithm to solve Laplace's equation in distributed memory, using MPI with one-sided communication.
